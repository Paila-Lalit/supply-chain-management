A comprehensive supply chain management system designed to optimize logistics, enhance inventory control, and streamline operations across the supply chain.

## Project Overview
This interactive dashboard provides real-time visibility into key supply chain metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making. Through intuitive visualizations, users can monitor supplier performance, track inventory levels, analyze transportation costs, and identify bottlenecks across the entire supply chain.

## 1. In this project scenario, I have been asked to create a dashboard for Supply chain management. The stakeholder wants to know the insight of specific KPIs and any other valuable insights to share on the dashboard. The KPIs to show are given in the image below:

## 3. Data Cleaning
I cleaned the data in excel before importing it to power BI. Removed blank rows and null values.
## 4. Data Modelling
I made relation between 9 tables to get the insights.
